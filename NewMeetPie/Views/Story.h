Busy airport 20 min ques to drop off bag, 30 minutes queue for security
flight delayed.  Very full.  Inteminable queue to get on plane.

I am like the last perosn and I get to my window seat and there is a kid in it.
I say Im in F - he looks up at me and then at a women in the aisle who looks up at me
and asys - do you mind if he sits in the window?

So I think - well hes just a kid andhes probably excited to be on a place for the
first tome or something so I say thats fine.  Then I look at thge mother in the aisle
seat and I say would you like to sit next to your son?  Looking at the middle seat.

She looks at me without skipping a beat she says.  No.  I like the aisle.

So I am just so surpised i dont quite kow what to say.  So I just raise my eyebrows and
sit there.  I give her a dirty look and she says look i always book an aisle seat and I
say well i always book a window seat.  And she just says - well lucky its just a short flight.

And thats it.  Then the pair of them just go back to looking at the pohones.  Even the the little brat
who isnt even looig out the fucking window
